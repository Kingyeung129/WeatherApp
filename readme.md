# **Simple Weather Application (CSS Only)**

## **Overview:**

### This weather app attempts to retreives your current location and display its current weather information. Animation are all done in **CSS only**, javascript is solely used for making API calls. The purpose of the project is to provide me an opportunity to practice my CSS skills, please forgive for the lousy code...<br/><br/>

## **APIs Used:**
### The following free APIs are used: **Openweatherapi** and **Geoapify**: 
### [Openweatherapi](https://openweathermap.org/current) is for getting **current weather data**. (refer to the documentation and the following API endpoint for more information).
> https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API_key}
### [Geoapify](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/forward-geocoding/#about) is for **reverse geocoding** and converting retrieved user coordinates into easily understandable, meaningful and readable street address.
> https://api.geoapify.com/v1/geocode/reverse?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY}
#### *Although Openweatherapi has a geocoding API as well, I prefered using Geoapify instead as I wanted to practice using javascript to make API calls with different API endpoiints.*
### This project is inspired by Codepen projects. As such, all animations made in this project are completely made with **CSS only**.<br/><br/>
  
## **Future Updates:**<br/>
* Add more animations and include functions to view 5 days forecast

#### **PS:** This is my first time writing a readme file, please forgive me for the lousy formatting :sweat_smile:
